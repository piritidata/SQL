# <ins>**Piritiga's SQL Portfolio**</ins>

## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of SQL projects that demonstrate my ability to work with relational databases, write efficient and well-structured queries, and extract meaningful insights from data. 
*Each project includes the SQL scripts used, along with comments or documentation explaining the problem/project, approach, and results. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any further questions.*
