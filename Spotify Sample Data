#Using imported sample data from a CSV file, the following analysis was done below:

SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- Who are the top 10 artists listened to on Spotify based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, SUM(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY SUM(popularity) desc;

-- Calculate the average popularity for the artists in the Spotify data table. Then for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, show their name, their average popularity, and label them as a "Top Star". Use a CTE in this case.
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM Spotifydata AS s
GROUP BY s.artist_name)

SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' as tag 
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity>= 90;
